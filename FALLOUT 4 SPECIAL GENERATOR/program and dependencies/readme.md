Alright so this is the Starting Stat generator and the things you need to run it. It should be good to. You can choose how many times you want it to run. I don't know if that's useful for players, but it was useful for testing, since it showed me that I had some problems with earlier versions.

One thing the older versions messed up on was that in the game, you can't start higher than 10 in any stat, so I had to go back and have a check for that sort of thing before any points become allocated to any stat.

That's the kind of thing that wouldn't jump out at me right away, and only was found after running the program a few hundred times.
