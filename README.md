# Raptor-Projects
RAPTOR is a fun flow chart-based programming environment/"language." Here are some of my own projects or old homework assignments.

Lotto Generator.cs is the C# version of the code. The .cpp is the C++.

The Lotto Generator app started as a way for me to make my own quick pick numbers, since it seemed like the ones I'd get at stores weren't working for me. 

I was satisfied with my little program until I tested it more and forgot to check for repeat numbers. Whoops. So the fixed version is coming soon.

The other program on here is a random stat generator for new Fallout 4 characters. I got tired of trying to figure out how to start  new characters and made this.
