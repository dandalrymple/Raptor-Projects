# Raptor-Projects
RAPTOR is a fun flow chart-based programming environment/"language." I had a class that taught it and ALICE in the Fall of 2015. I had a lot more fun with RAPTOR.

Here are some of my own projects or old homework assignments.

One of the great things about RAPTOR is that it lets you generate C#, C++, Ada, and Java versions of its programs, as well as create standalone .exe files. The standalones require some .dll files to work correctly, and usually come in the same folder when the program is created.

Files with the .rap extension are for use with the RAPTOR environment and show the flow charts and other information when RAPTOR is used.
